## Not all groups are teams: How to tell the difference

A "team" is *a small number of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose, set of performance goals, and approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable.*

How is this different from a "working group"?

### Working Group

- Strong, clearly focused leader
- Individual accountability
- Group's purpose is the same as the broader organizational mission
- Individual work products
- Runs efficient meetings
- Measures its effectiveness indirectly by its influence on others (e.g. uptake in users)
- Discusses, decides, and delegates

### Team

- Shared leadership roles
- Individual _and_ mutual accountability
- Specific team purpose that the team itself delivers
- Collective work products
- Encourages open-ended discussion and active problem-solving meetings
- Measures performance directly by assessing collective work products
- Discusses, decides, and does real work together

## Discipline of teams

Essential elements of a successful team:

1. Meaningful common purpose that the team helped shape. The team must "own" this purpose.
2. Specific performance goals derived from the common purpose
3. Mix of complementary skills
4. Strong commitment to how work gets done. Includes: who does it, how schedules are set, how decisions are made and modified
5. Mutual accountability, not just accountability to team leader
